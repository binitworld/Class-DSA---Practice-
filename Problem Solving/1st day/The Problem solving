# Ideas Should BE IMPLEMENTED

Use Pe-sudo Code 
for the implementation 
keywords are  Input, COMPUTE, PRINT , INCREMENT, DEcrement, ...........
>first to analyze the problem then Start solution


# Divide and Conquer Method  
Binary Doubling
>> double every previous digit and add it to the current digit of the binary number, starting from the left-most digit and moving towards the right.


# Dynamic Programming:
3. Dynamic Programming

>Another general strategy for problem-solving which is useful when we can build-up the solution as a sequence of the intermediate steps

The idea here is that a good or optimal solution to a problem can be built-up from good or optimal solutions of the sub-problems

>The problem should be able to be divided into smaller overlapping sub- 27 problem

>An optimum-solution can be achieved by using an optimum solution of smaller sub-problems

>Dynamic algorithms use Memoization ie. remembering the result of overlapping sub-problems.
