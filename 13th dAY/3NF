43) What is 3NF?
3NF stands for Third Normal Form. A database is called in 3NF if it satisfies the following conditions:

It is in second normal form.
There is no transitive functional dependency.
For example: X->Z
Where:
X->Y
Y does not -> X
Y->Z so, X->Z

44) What is BCNF?
BCMF stands for Boyce-Codd Normal Form. It is an advanced version of 3NF, so it is also referred to as 3.5NF. BCNF is stricter than 3NF.

A table complies with BCNF if it satisfies the following conditions:

It is in 3NF.
For every functional dependency X->Y, X should be the super key of the table. It merely means that X cannot be a non-prime attribute if Y is a prime attribute.
